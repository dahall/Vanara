	/// To create an instance of a named pipe by using <c>CreateNamedPipe</c>, the user must have <c>FILE_CREATE_PIPE_INSTANCE</c> access to
	/// the named pipe object. If a new named pipe is being created, the access control list (ACL) from the security attributes parameter
	/// defines the discretionary access control for the named pipe.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// All instances of a named pipe must specify the same pipe type (byte-type or message-type), pipe access (duplex, inbound, or
	/// outbound), instance count, and time-out value. If different values are used, this function fails and GetLastError returns <c>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</c>.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// A client process connects to a named pipe by using the CreateFile or CallNamedPipe function. The client side of a named pipe starts
	/// out in byte mode, even if the server side is in message mode. To avoid problems receiving data, set the client side to message mode
	/// as well. To change the mode of the pipe, the pipe client must open a read-only pipe with <c>GENERIC_READ</c> and
	/// <c>FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES</c> access.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The pipe server should not perform a blocking read operation until the pipe client has started. Otherwise, a race condition can
	/// occur. This typically occurs when initialization code, such as the C run-time, needs to lock and examine inherited handles.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Every time a named pipe is created, the system creates the inbound and/or outbound buffers using nonpaged pool, which is the physical
	/// memory used by the kernel. The number of pipe instances (as well as objects such as threads and processes) that you can create is
	/// limited by the available nonpaged pool. Each read or write request requires space in the buffer for the read or write data, plus
	/// additional space for the internal data structures.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The input and output buffer sizes are advisory. The actual buffer size reserved for each end of the named pipe is either the system
	/// default, the system minimum or maximum, or the specified size rounded up to the next allocation boundary. The buffer size specified
	/// should be small enough that your process will not run out of nonpaged pool, but large enough to accommodate typical requests.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Whenever a pipe write operation occurs, the system first tries to charge the memory against the pipe write quota. If the remaining
	/// pipe write quota is enough to fulfill the request, the write operation completes immediately. If the remaining pipe write quota is
	/// too small to fulfill the request, the system will try to expand the buffers to accommodate the data using nonpaged pool reserved for
	/// the process. The write operation will block until the data is read from the pipe so that the additional buffer quota can be released.
	/// Therefore, if your specified buffer size is too small, the system will grow the buffer as needed, but the downside is that the
	/// operation will block. If the operation is overlapped, a system thread is blocked; otherwise, the application thread is blocked.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// To free resources used by a named pipe, the application should always close handles when they are no longer needed, which is
	/// accomplished either by calling the CloseHandle function or when the process associated with the instance handles ends. Note that an
	/// instance of a named pipe may have more than one handle associated with it. An instance of a named pipe is always deleted when the
	/// last handle to the instance of the named pipe is closed.
