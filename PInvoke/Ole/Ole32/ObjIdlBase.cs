	/// of the object. At this point, the server object calls IOleClientSite::SaveObject on the link container, and the link container's
	/// return call to IPersistStorage::Save fails because the stub manager no longer has a pointer to the embedded object. Any unsaved

	/// <summary>Enables a COM object to define and manage the marshaling of its interface pointers.</summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// Marshaling is the process of packaging data into packets for transmission to a different process or computer. Unmarshaling is
	/// the process of recovering that data at the receiving end. In any given call, method arguments are marshaled and unmarshaled in
	/// one direction, while return values are marshaled and unmarshaled in the other.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Although marshaling applies to all data types, interface pointers require special handling. The fundamental problem is how
	/// client code running in one address space can correctly dereference a pointer to an interface on an object residing in a
	/// different address space. The COM solution is for a client application to communicate with the original object through a
	/// surrogate object, or proxy, which lives in the client's process. The proxy holds a reference to an interface on the original
	/// object and hands the client a pointer to an interface on itself. When the client calls an interface method on the original
	/// object, its call is actually going to the proxy. Therefore, from the client's point of view, all calls are in-process.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// On receiving a call, the proxy marshals the method arguments and through some means of interprocess communication, such as RPC,
	/// passes them along to code in the server process, which unmarshals the arguments and passes them to the original object. This
	/// same code marshals return values for transmission back to the proxy, which unmarshals the values and passes them to the client application.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// <c>IMarshal</c> provides methods for creating, initializing, and managing a proxy in a client process; it does not dictate how
	/// the proxy should communicate with the original object. The COM default implementation of <c>IMarshal</c> uses RPC. When you
	/// implement this interface yourself, you are free to choose any method of interprocess communication you deem to be appropriate
	/// for your application—shared memory, named pipe, window handle, RPC—in short, whatever works.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>IMarshal Default Implementation</para>
	/// <para>
	/// COM uses its own internal implementation of the <c>IMarshal</c> interface to marshal any object that does not provide its own
	/// implementation. COM makes this determination by querying the object for <c>IMarshal</c>. If the interface is missing, COM
	/// defaults to its internal implementation.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The COM default implementation of <c>IMarshal</c> uses a generic proxy for each object and creates individual stubs and proxies,
	/// as they are needed, for each interface implemented on the object. This mechanism is necessary because COM cannot know in advance
	/// what particular interfaces a given object may implement. Developers who do not use COM default marshaling, electing instead to
	/// write their own proxy and marshaling routines, know at compile time all the interfaces to be found on their objects and
	/// therefore understand exactly what marshaling code is required. COM, in providing marshaling support for all objects, must do so
	/// at run time.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The interface proxy resides in the client process; the interface stub resides in the server. Together, each pair handles all
	/// marshaling for the interface. The job of each interface proxy is to marshal arguments and unmarshal return values and out
	/// parameters that are passed back and forth in subsequent calls to its interface. The job of each interface stub is to unmarshal
	/// function arguments and pass them along to the original object and then marshal the return values and out parameters that the
	/// object returns.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Proxy and stub communicate by means of an RPC (remote procedure call) channel, which utilizes the system's RPC infrastructure
	/// for interprocess communication. The RPC channel implements a single interface, IRpcChannelBuffer, to which both interface
	/// proxies and stubs hold a pointer. The proxy and stub call the interface to obtain a marshaling packet, send the data to their
	/// counterpart, and destroy the packet when they are done. The interface stub also holds a pointer to the original object.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// For any given interface, the proxy and stub are both implemented as instances of the same class, which is listed for each
	/// interface in the system registry under the label <c>ProxyStubClsid32</c>. This entry maps the interface's IID to the
	/// <c>CLSID</c> of its proxy and stub objects. When COM needs to marshal an interface, it looks in the system registry to obtain
	/// the appropriate <c>CLSID</c>. The server identified by this <c>CLSID</c> implements both the interface proxy and interface stub.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Most often, the class to which this <c>CLSID</c> refers is automatically generated by a tool whose input is a description of the
	/// function signatures and semantics of a given interface, written in some interface description language. While using such a
	/// language is highly recommended and encouraged for accuracy's sake, doing so is not required. Proxies and stubs are merely COM
	/// components used by the RPC infrastructure and, as such, can be written in any manner desired, as long as the correct external
	/// contracts are upheld. The programmer who designs a new interface is responsible for ensuring that all interface proxies and
	/// stubs that ever exist agree on the representation of their marshaled data.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// When created, interface proxies are always aggregated into a larger proxy, which represents the object as a whole. This object
	/// proxy also aggregates the COM generic proxy object, which is known as the proxy manager. The proxy manager implements two
	/// interfaces: IUnknown and <c>IMarshal</c>. All of the other interfaces that may be implemented on an object are exposed in its
	/// object proxy through the aggregation of individual interface proxies. A client holding a pointer to the object proxy "believes"
	/// it holds a pointer to the actual object.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// A proxy representing the object as a whole is required in the client process so that a client can distinguish calls to the same
	/// interfaces implemented on entirely different objects. Such a requirement does not exist in the server process, however, where
	/// the object itself resides, because all interface stubs communicate only with the objects for which they were created. No other
	/// connection is possible.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Interface stubs, by contrast with interface proxies, are not aggregated because there is no need that they appear to some
	/// external client to be part of a larger whole. When connected, an interface stub is given a pointer to the server object to which
	/// it should forward method invocations that it receives. Although it is useful to refer conceptually to a stub manager, meaning
	/// whatever pieces of code and state in the server-side RPC infrastructure that service the remoting of a given object, there is no
	/// direct requirement that the code and state take any particular, well-specified form.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The first time a client requests a pointer to an interface on a particular object, COM loads an IClassFactory stub in the server
	/// process and uses it to marshal the first pointer back to the client. In the client process, COM loads the generic proxy for the
	/// class factory object and calls its implementation of <c>IMarshal</c> to unmarshal that first pointer. COM then creates the first
	/// interface proxy and hands it a pointer to the RPC channel. Finally, COM returns the <c>IClassFactory</c> pointer to the client,
	/// which uses it to call IClassFactory::CreateInstance, passing it a reference to the interface.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Back in the server process, COM now creates a new instance of the object, along with a stub for the requested interface. This
	/// stub marshals the interface pointer back to the client process, where another object proxy is created, this time for the object
	/// itself. Also created is a proxy for the requested interface, a pointer to which is returned to the client. With subsequent calls
	/// to other interfaces on the object, COM will load the appropriate interface stubs and proxies as needed.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// When a new interface proxy is created, COM hands it a pointer to the proxy manager's implementation of IUnknown, to which it
	/// delegates all QueryInterface calls. Each interface proxy implements two interfaces of its own: the interface it represents and
	/// IRpcProxyBuffer. The interface proxy exposes its own interface directly to clients, which can obtain its pointer by calling
	/// <c>QueryInterface</c> on the proxy manager. Only COM, however, can call <c>IRpcProxyBuffer</c>, which is used to connect and
	/// disconnect the proxy to the RPC channel. A client cannot query an interface proxy to obtain a pointer to the
	/// <c>IRpcProxyBuffer</c> interface.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// On the server side, each interface stub implements IRpcStubBuffer. The server code acting as a stub manager calls
	/// IRpcStubBuffer::Connect and passes the interface stub the IUnknown pointer of its object.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// When an interface proxy receives a method invocation, it obtains a marshaling packet from its RPC channel through a call to
	/// IRpcChannelBuffer::GetBuffer. The process of marshaling the arguments will copy data into the buffer. When marshaling is
	/// complete, the interface proxy invokes IRpcChannelBuffer::SendReceive to send the marshaled packet to the corresponding interface
	/// stub. When <c>IRpcChannelBuffer::SendReceive</c> returns, the buffer into which the arguments were marshaled will have been
	/// replaced by a new buffer containing the return values marshaled from the interface stub. The interface proxy unmarshals the
	/// return values, invokes IRpcChannelBuffer::FreeBuffer to free the buffer, and then returns the return values to the original
	/// caller of the method.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// It is the implementation of IRpcChannelBuffer::SendReceive that actually sends the request to the server process and that knows
	/// how to identify the server process and, within that process, the object to which the request should be sent. The channel
	/// implementation also knows how to forward the request on to the appropriate stub manager in that process. The interface stub
	/// unmarshals the arguments from the provided buffer, invokes the indicated method on the server object, and marshals the return
	/// values back into a new buffer allocated by a call to IRpcChannelBuffer::GetBuffer. The channel then transmits the return data
	/// packet back to the interface proxy, which is still in the middle of <c>IRpcChannelBuffer::SendReceive</c>, which returns to the
	/// interface proxy.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// A particular instance of an interface proxy can be used to service more than one interface, as long as the following conditions
	/// are met:
	/// </para>
	/// <list type="bullet">
	/// <item>
	/// <term>The IIDs of the affected interfaces must be mapped to the appropriate ProxyStubClsid in the system registry.</term>
	/// </item>
	/// <item>
	/// <term>
	/// The interface proxy must support calls to QueryInterface from one supported interface to the other interfaces, as usual, as well
	/// as from IUnknown and IRpcProxyBuffer.
	/// </term>
	/// </item>
	/// </list>
	/// <para>
	/// A single instance of an interface stub can also service more than one interface, but only if that set of interfaces has a strict
	/// single-inheritance relationship. This restriction exists because the stub can direct method invocations to multiple interfaces
	/// only where it knows in advance which methods are implemented on which interfaces.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// At various times, proxies and stubs will have need to allocate or free memory. Interface proxies, for example, will need to
	/// allocate memory in which to return out parameters to their caller. In this respect, interface proxies and interface stubs are
	/// just normal COM components, in that they should use the standard task allocator. (See CoGetMalloc.)
