	/// sequence, or without using mutual authentication, RPC_S_INVALID_ARG is returned from the RpcBindingSetAuthInfoEx function call.
	/// This flag is designed to prevent a Denial of Service Attack. Using this flag forces the RPC Runtime to ask the endpoint mapper

	/// RPC supports the RPC_C_QOS_CAPABILITIES_LOCAL_MA_HINT hint (unsupported on Windows XP and earlier client editions, unsupported
	/// on Windows 2000 and earlier server editions). This hint is used only when dynamic endpoints and mutual authentication are used.
	/// Furthermore, it is not supported for the <c>ncadg_</c> protocol sequences. If this flag is used for a <c>ncadg_</c> protocol
	/// sequence, or without using mutual authentication, RPC_S_INVALID_ARG is returned from the RpcBindingSetAuthInfoEx function call.
	/// This flag is designed to prevent a Denial of Service Attack. Using this flag forces the RPC Runtime to ask the endpoint mapper
	/// only for endpoints registered by the principal specified in the <c>ServerPrincName</c> or <c>Sid</c> members. This prevents an
	/// attacker on the local machine from trying to trick your RPC client to connect to a spoof endpoint it has registered in the
	/// endpoint mapper. Note that since the attack is local only (such as from a terminal server machine with many users), the flag
	/// also works only for RPC calls made locally.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// <c>Note</c> Some security providers, such as Kerberos, support delegation-impersonation type. On Windows editions that support
	/// delegation-impersonation type, if the client has asked for delegation but the security provider is unable to provide it, the
	/// call fails with PRC_S_SEC_PKG_ERROR unless the RPC_C_QOS_CAPABILITIES_IGNORE_DELEGATE_FAILURE flag is specified.
