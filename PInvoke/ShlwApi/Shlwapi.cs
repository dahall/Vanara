	/// <para>
	/// <c>Note</c> Prior to Windows Vista, <c>QISearch</c> was not exported by name or declared in a public header file. To use it in

	/// If the requested interface is IUnknown, then <c>QISearch</c> uses the first entry of the specified array of QITAB structures.
	/// Otherwise, <c>QISearch</c> searches the table until it either finds a matching IID or reaches the end of the table. If a matching
	/// IID is found, the function advances the associated interface pointer by the number of bytes specified by the <c>dwOffset</c>
	/// member of the interface's <c>QITAB</c> structure and reinterpreted as a COM pointer. That pointer is assigned to the
	/// <c>QISearch</c> function's ppv parameter. The method also calls IUnknown::AddRef to increment the interface's reference count.
	/// </para>

	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// It is important to include all applicable interfaces in the table. For example, if the object implements a derived interface, you
	/// should also include the base interface in the table.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// We recommend that you use the IID_PPV_ARGS macro, defined in Objbase.h, to package the riid and ppv parameters. This macro
	/// provides the correct IID based on the interface pointed to by the value in ppv, which eliminates the possibility of a coding
	/// error in riid that could lead to unexpected results.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// <c>Note</c> Active Template Library (ATL) provides a significantly better version of a table-driven implementation of QueryInterface.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>Examples</para>
	/// <para>
	/// The following example illustrates how to use <c>QISearch</c> to implement QueryInterface. It uses the offsetofclass macro from
	/// ATL to compute the offset from the base of the CSample object to a specified interface.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// This object supports two interfaces aside from IUnknown, so there are two non- <c>NULL</c> entries in the QITAB table. The entry
	/// for each interface specifies a pointer to the associated IID (IID_IPersist or IID_IPersistFolder) and the offset of the interface
	/// pointer relative to the class's base pointer. The sample uses the <c>offsetofclass</c> macro from ATL to determine that offset.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// <c>Note</c> Forgetting to include all base classes, including indirect ones, is a common error. Notice that there is an entry for

	/// The inverse color mapping table is a table of 32,768 bytes. It contains the indexes of colors in the halftone palette. Each index
	/// is stored at a position in the buffer that corresponds to a particular RGB value expressed in 555 format. These pairings allow

	/// </para>
	/// <list type="number">
	/// <item>
	/// <term>
	/// Decompose the color into its red, green, and blue components. In this case, the red component is 0x30, the green component is
	/// 0x60 and the blue component is 0x40.
	/// </term>
	/// </item>
	/// <item>
	/// <term>
	/// Reassemble the color into 555 format. The formula for reducing a 24-bit RGB color into 555 format is shown here. In this example,
	/// the value in 555 format is ((0x30 / 8) &lt;&lt; 10) + ((0x60 / 8) &lt;&lt; 5) + (0x40 / 8) = 6536.
	/// </term>
	/// </item>
	/// <item>
	/// <term>
	/// The index value stored in position 6536 in the inverse color map table is the index of the color in the halftone palette that is
